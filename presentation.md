# Why Master Data Management?

---

## The Data Fragmentation Challenge

Organizations struggle with:

- üîÑ **Multiple versions** of the same entity across systems
- üìâ **Inconsistent data quality** leading to poor decisions
- ‚è∞ **Manual reconciliation** efforts that are time-consuming
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Compliance risks** from inaccurate data

**Result:** Fragmented view of critical business entities

---

## MDM Value Proposition

MDM creates a **single source of truth** enabling:

- üìä **Improved Decision Making** - Reliable analytics
- ‚ö° **Operational Efficiency** - Reduced errors
- üéØ **Enhanced Customer Experience** - 360-degree view
- ‚úÖ **Regulatory Compliance** - Accurate reporting
- üí∞ **Cost Reduction** - Eliminate manual reconciliation

---

## Common Use Cases

| Domain | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **Customer** | 360-degree view across CRM, e-commerce, support |
| **Product** | Consolidate supplier catalogs and inventory |
| **Supplier** | Unified records across procurement and finance |
| **Healthcare** | Patient record consolidation |
| **Travel** | Hotel room deduplication between suppliers |

# Architecture Overview

---

## Three Architectural Views

1. **Complete Architecture** - Both approaches side-by-side
2. **GCP Native (DIY)** - 100% Google Cloud services
3. **Third-Party** - Tamr, Reltio, Informatica integration

Each approach addresses the same core challenge with different trade-offs

---

## Complete Architecture

**Build vs. Buy**
- DIY Path (Pink)
- 3rd-Party Path (Green)
- Shared Infrastructure

---

## GCP Native Architecture

![bg right:60% 90%](images/mdm_architecture_gcp.png)

**100% GCP Services**
- Advanced ML matching
- Human-in-the-loop
- Full control & flexibility

---

## Third-Party Architecture

![bg right:60% 90%](images/mdm_architecture_3pt.png)

**Vendor Solutions**
- Faster time-to-value
- Pre-built capabilities
- Managed complexity

# Core Architectural Concepts

---

## Four Main Blocks

1. **Data Ingestion & Collection**
2. **Data Preparation & Mastering**
3. **Data Governance**
4. **Distribution & Consumption**

Each block represents a critical stage in the MDM lifecycle

---

## Block 1: Data Ingestion & Collection

### Multiple Ingestion Patterns

- **Real-time:** `Pub/Sub` for streaming data
- **Batch/Files:** `GCS Landing Zone` for file-based data
- **SaaS/Scheduled:** `BQ Data Transfer Service` for managed ingestion
- **Processing:** `Dataflow` or `Cloud Data Fusion` for ETL/ELT

---

## Block 2: Data Preparation & Mastering

### The Core "Build vs. Buy" Decision

**DIY Path:**
- `BigQuery` staging and processing
- Multiple matching strategies
- Human-in-the-loop stewardship

**Third-Party Path:**
- Specialized MDM tools (Tamr, Reltio)
- ML-powered automation
- Faster implementation

---

## Block 3: Data Governance

### Comprehensive Governance Layer

- **Cataloging & Lineage:** `Dataplex` unified catalog
- **Access Control:** `Cloud IAM` and `BigQuery Security`
- **Privacy & Compliance:** `Cloud DLP` for PII protection

Applies to both DIY and third-party approaches

---

## Block 4: Distribution & Consumption

### Multiple Consumption Patterns

- **Analytics:** `Looker` for business intelligence
- **APIs:** `Apigee` for secure data access
- **Event-Driven:** `Pub/Sub` for real-time notifications
- **Operational:** `Cloud SQL/Spanner` for low-latency lookups

# Key Design Decisions

---

## 1. Build vs. Buy Strategy

| Aspect | DIY (Build) | Third-Party (Buy) |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Control** | Full control | Vendor-dependent |
| **Time** | Longer development | Faster deployment |
| **Cost** | Development effort | Licensing fees |
| **Flexibility** | Highly customizable | Pre-built features |

---

## 2. State-of-the-Art DIY Stack

### Multiple Matching Strategies

- **Traditional Rules:** `BQ SQL Match` for deterministic rules
- **Vector Search:** `Vertex AI Embeddings` + `BQ VECTOR_SEARCH`
- **Identity Resolution:** `BQ Entity Resolution Framework` (LiveRamp)
- **Enrichment:** `Cloud Functions` + external APIs
- **Quality:** `Dataplex Data Quality` monitoring

---

## 3. Human-in-the-Loop Process

### Critical for Data Accuracy

```
High-confidence matches ‚Üí Automatic processing
Low-confidence matches ‚Üí Human review queue
Human verification ‚Üí Feed back to system
```

**Tools:** `AppSheet` UI + `BQ Stewardship Queue`

---

## 4. Decoupled Survivorship Logic

### Business Rules as Configuration

- **Survivorship Rules** defined by business users
- Applied at final `Write Mastered Data` step
- Easy to update without re-engineering pipeline
- Supports complex business logic

# Implementation Deep Dive

---

## Advanced Matching Techniques

### Vector Search for Fuzzy Matching

1. Generate embeddings with `Vertex AI`
2. Store in `BigQuery` with vector columns
3. Use `VECTOR_SEARCH` for similarity matching
4. Resilient to typos and variations

**Perfect for:** Names, addresses, product descriptions

---

## Data Quality Framework

### Automated Quality Assurance

- **Dataplex Data Quality** rules and monitoring
- **Cloud DLP** for sensitive data detection
- **Custom validation** via Cloud Functions
- **Continuous monitoring** and alerting

---

## Stewardship Workflow

### Human-in-the-Loop Details

1. **Match Results** ‚Üí Confidence scoring
2. **Low confidence** ‚Üí `BQ Stewardship Queue`
3. **AppSheet UI** ‚Üí Human review and decision
4. **Verified matches** ‚Üí Back to processing
5. **Learning loop** ‚Üí Improve future matching

# Migration Strategy

---

## From Legacy MDM Systems

### Assessment Phase

1. **Current State Analysis** - Document data models and rules
2. **Rule Migration** - Catalog matching and survivorship logic
3. **Integration Mapping** - Identify all touchpoints

### Migration Approach

- **Phased migration** by data domain
- **Parallel run** for validation
- **Rule translation** to GCP services

---

## GCP Advantages

### Why Choose Google Cloud?

- **Scalability:** Handle massive data volumes
- **Cost Efficiency:** Pay-as-you-go model
- **ML Integration:** Advanced matching capabilities
- **Cloud-Native:** Seamless service integration
- **Security:** Enterprise-grade governance
