# MDM Architecture: BigQuery-Native vs. Traditional Systems

This document provides a high-level architectural comparison between the BigQuery-native MDM solution presented in this repository and traditional Master Data Management (MDM) platforms like Informatica MDM or IBM InfoSphere.

## Key Differentiator: Unified vs. Siloed Architecture

The fundamental difference is that the **BigQuery-native approach is a unified, single-platform architecture**, whereas **traditional MDM systems are multi-component, siloed architectures**.

-   **Traditional MDM:** Requires separate, specialized tools for each step of the process: a database for storage, an ETL tool for data movement, a dedicated matching engine for processing, and another tool for data quality and stewardship. This creates significant complexity and data movement overhead.
-   **BigQuery-Native MDM:** Leverages a single, integrated platform. BigQuery itself handles storage, data processing (SQL), ETL (SQL), matching (SQL + BigQuery ML), and data quality. This dramatically simplifies the architecture, reduces data movement, and lowers total cost of ownership.

## Architectural Comparison

### 1. Traditional MDM Architecture (Siloed) with BigQuery Function Equivalents

Traditional systems involve a complex chain of separate components, each requiring its own infrastructure, licensing, and expertise. Data is constantly being moved between these different environments, increasing latency and points of failure. **Each component shown below can be replaced by a simple BigQuery function.**

**Key Observations:**
- **üîÑ Data Movement Overhead**: Notice the constant "Extract ‚Üí Process ‚Üí Load" cycle between separate systems
- **üí∞ Multiple Licenses Required**: Each component requires separate licensing (ETL tool, database, matching engine, etc.)
- **üèóÔ∏è Complex Infrastructure**: Each component needs its own compute, storage, and management
- **üìù Simple BigQuery Alternative**: Each complex component can be replaced by a Python function generating SQL

*This diagram illustrates how traditional MDM requires multiple "hops" between different licensed software and hardware stacks, while BigQuery functions achieve the same result with simple SQL generation.*

### 2. BigQuery-Native MDM Architecture (Unified & Function-Mapped)

The BigQuery-native approach consolidates all these functions into a single, serverless platform. Each component from the traditional architecture is replaced by a simple Python function that generates SQL, eliminating data movement and simplifying the entire pipeline.

        BQ_GOLDEN["<b>Golden Record Creation</b><br/>generate_golden_record_sql()<br/><i>Replaces: Survivorship Rule Engine</i>"]
    end

    subgraph Consumption["C. Consumption"]
        LOOKER["Looker / BI Tools"]
        API_LAYER["Cloud Functions / APIs"]
        STEWARD_UI["Custom Stewardship App"]
    end

    %% Data Flow - Sequential Processing
    Sources -- "Load via ELT" --> BQ_STORAGE
    BQ_STORAGE --> BQ_ETL
    BQ_ETL --> BQ_EMBED
    BQ_EMBED --> BQ_MATCH
    BQ_MATCH --> BQ_COMBINE
    BQ_COMBINE --> BQ_GOLDEN
    BQ_GOLDEN --> BQ_STORAGE
    BQ_STORAGE --> Consumption

    class BQ_STORAGE,BQ_ETL,BQ_EMBED,BQ_MATCH,BQ_COMBINE,BQ_GOLDEN unified
```

**Function-to-Component Mapping:**
- **`generate_union_sql()` + `generate_standardization_sql()`** ‚Üí Replaces dedicated ETL tools (Informatica PowerCenter, Talend)
- **`generate_embedding_sql()`** ‚Üí Replaces separate vector databases and AI infrastructure
- **5 Matching Functions** ‚Üí Replaces entire MDM matching engine clusters
- **`generate_combined_scoring_sql()`** ‚Üí Replaces proprietary decision engines
- **`generate_golden_record_sql()`** ‚Üí Replaces survivorship rule engines and stewardship UIs

*This diagram shows how each traditional MDM component is replaced by a simple Python function generating SQL, all executing within a single unified platform.*
